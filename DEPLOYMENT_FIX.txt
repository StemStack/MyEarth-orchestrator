# ADD THIS TO YOUR .replit FILE TO FIX DEPLOYMENT

# Add this section at the end of your .replit file:

[deployment]
run = ["python", "main.py"]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
ignorePorts = false

[deployment.env]
PORT = "5000"

# This will resolve all three deployment errors:
# 1. Missing deployment section in .replit file
# 2. No build command provided while using Cloud Run deployment  
# 3. Run command references undefined $file variable

# After adding this, your deployment should work properly.
